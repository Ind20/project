                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
                    Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
                    unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
                    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
                    the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
                    with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
                    Ipsum.

                    Why do we use it?
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
                    content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that
                    it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content
                    here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
                    packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
                    search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various
                    versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
                    (injected humour and the like).</p>
